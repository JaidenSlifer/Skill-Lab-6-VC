Reasons for MIT License:

MIT License was chosen due to its simplicity and permissive nature. Without becoming too complicated to easily comprehend, it allows full use of the repository
files for any reason, including commercial usage, while also removing author liability.

Reasons for Contributor Covenant:

We chose the Contributor Covenant because it goes above and beyond in making the code of conduct very clear. Instead of just listing what isn't allowed, who to contact,
and the possible punishments, it also gives detailed examples of both good and bad behaviors. Additionally, we liked the way it begins with a pledge for a welcoming
community.
